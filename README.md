# ðŸš¨ PIR Motion Detection using ESP8266 and ThingSpeak

This project uses a **PIR motion sensor** connected to a **NodeMCU ESP8266** to detect motion and send real-time data to **ThingSpeak**, a cloud-based IoT analytics platform. The data can be monitored via the **ThingSpeak dashboard or mobile app**, making it ideal for basic **home security** and **motion detection applications**.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects motion using a PIR sensor (e.g., HC-SR501).
- Sends real-time sensor data to ThingSpeak.
- View motion status remotely via **ThingSpeak web dashboard** or app.
- Serial Monitor outputs real-time status for debugging and local monitoring.
- Wi-Fi-based IoT implementation (no additional gateway needed).
